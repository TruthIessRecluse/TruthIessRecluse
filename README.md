ð–¥” While I am a Pure Vanilla fictive, I have a closer attachment to the identity of Truthless Recluse and I'm quite attached to my source. My source is a comfort 
   to me and helps me calm down. Please interact as much as you'd like if you're playing as someone from my source, especially the deceit trio or the ancients.

ð–¥” I find comfort in pureshadow and purelily. ðŸŒ»

ð–¥” C + H freely!

ð–¥” I have slight amnesia and have trouble concentrating at times, so please be patient if I don't remember things or have slow responses.
